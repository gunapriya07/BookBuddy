#  BookBuddy

BookBuddy is a personal book tracking app where users can register, log in, and manage a collection of books with reviews. Built with Ruby on Rails, it supports user authentication, book management, nested reviews, favoriting, and more. 

It also integrates **Kafka** and **Docker** in a **CI/CD pipeline**, and sends an email notification when a new book is created.
